# SimosHighSpeedLogger

This is a series of scripts used for making a UDS connection to a Simos18 ECU (assuming it has a compatible ASW).
This was developed around the Eurodyne Maestro ECU in the MQB chassis VW/Audi

## Installation

Installation is relatively straightforward.  Assuming you have a working pi with piCan hat, drivers, etc:

clone the repository into the home directory of your pi user

```bash
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ whoami
pi
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ pwd
/home/pi
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ git clone https://github.com/joeFischetti/SimosHighSpeedLogger.git
Cloning into 'SimosHighSpeedLogger'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 58, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (58/58), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (35/35), done.
remote: Total 58 (delta 23), reused 49 (delta 14), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (58/58), done.
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cd SimosHighSpeedLogger/
pi@raspberrypi:~/SimosHighSpeedLogger $ 
```

At this point, you'll have a basic, working, logger.

## Usage

### Basic
Using the logger with a front end is relatively straightforward.  With network connectivity to your pi and it plugged into the car, you can ssh in and run the logger with a TUI gague cluster:
```bash
pi@raspberrypi:~/SimosHighSpeedLogger $ python3 pyLog.py
```

You'll need to press "enter" to tell it to connect to the car, and when it does, you should get live display on the gauges.
Pressing the enter key will toggle logging on and off.

If, instead, you want to run it headless:

```bash
pi@raspberrypi:~/SimosHighSpeedLogger $ python3 pyLog.py --headless
```

Headless mode will trigger the logger to start logging when the cruise control has been turned on, and will stop logging 5 seconds after it's been turned off.  Cruise control does *not* need to be active, just on.

#### Additional notes
There's 2 additional files that are used by the logger.  Examples of each are provided.

##### parameters.yaml
parameters.yaml is used to define the memory locations, scaling factors, and size of each parameter you wish to log.  These are generally available via an A2L file and they *WILL* be specific to the software version running on your ECU.

```bash
Engine speed:
    length:  0x02
    signed:  False
    function:  "x/1.0"
    units:  "RPM"
    location: '0xD0012400'
```

##### config.yaml
config.yaml is used to define other configuration options that the logger can use.  At the time of writing, the config file currently only needs to be used to specify SMTP settings for notification emails from the script.  These emails are helpful (especially when running headless) because they will

1.Tell you when the logger has starter and what it's IP address is
2.Email you an activity log if the logger crashes, so you can see what happened


### Advanced
Since the logger has the capability of running headless, I've included a few scripts that can be used to trigger it when USB sticks are inserted.

systemd udev has the capability of triggering scripts based on specific events.  The following files within the repo are notable:
```
etc/systemd/system/usb-mount@.service
etc/systemd/system/pyLog@.service
etc/udev/rules.d/50-usbstick_test.rules
etc/udev/rules.d/50-usbstick.rules

usr/local/bin/usb-mount.sh
```

These files can be moved to their respective locations on the root filesystem.  Once you've done that:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

Descriptions of each file:
<pre>
etc/udev/rules.d/50-usbstick_test.rules
etc/udev/rules.d/50-usbstick.rules
These files are used to trigger events within udev.  They trigger the systemd file (which launches the mount script in /usr/local/bin)
</pre>

<pre>
etc/systemd/system/usb-mount@.service
This systemd file will mount the usb stick that was passed in the argument.  A script called via udev directly doesn't have the proper permissions to handle the mount operation
</pre>

<pre>
usr/local/bin/usb-mount.sh
This script is used to automatically mount the flash drive that was called, check the contents of it, and if there's a 'parameters.yaml' file, launch the pi in headless logging mode
</pre>

<pre>
etc/systemd/system/pyLog@.service
This is a systemd unit file that takes the USB mounted stick as a parameter.  It'll set that as both the output location for logs and as the parameter file to be used for reading logging parameters
</pre>

Argparse also does a great job displaying a basic help menu:
```bash
pi@raspberrypi:~/SimosHighSpeedLogger $ python3 pyLog.py --help
usage: pyLog.py [-h] [--headless] [--params PARAMS]

Simos18 High Speed Logger

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --headless
  --params PARAMS  location of a parameter file to use for parameters, specify
                   full path
```

# more DETAILED setup instructions

## General Raspnberry pi setup

Creating an SD card for the raspberry pi needs to be done from a computer with an SD card reader
Insert the card into the machine and follow the directions on this page:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/


From a fresh SDCard (still in the machine that you created it on)
Create an empty file to enable ssh.  

On mac/linux you could:
```
touch /boot/ssh
```

On Windows:
```
Open the SD card (boot) from windows explorer
right click -> new file -> ssh (with no extension)
```

Create a file (/boot/wpa_supplicant.txt) with wifi info if applicable


Once you boot up the Pi for the first time, SSH in and:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install python3-pip can-utils vim git
```

At the end of /boot/config.txt, add the following text:
If you've never used 'vim' before, you would type:
```bash 
sudo vim /boot/config.txt
```

Notes on vim - there's 'view' mode and 'edit' mode.
To enter "edit" mode, press 'i'.  To exit edit mode press 'escape'
To save the file, from view mode press `:` and then "w" (for write) and "q" (for quit)


```bash
dtparam=spi=on
dtoverlay=mcp2515-can0,oscillator=16000000,interrupt=25
dtoverlay=spi-bcm2835-overlay
```



Create a systemd unit file to auto start your can interface on boot

```
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/can0interface.service
```

with the following:

```bash
 [Unit]
 Description=Setup SocketCAN interface can0 with a baudrate of 500000
 After=multi-user.target
 [Service]
 Type=oneshot
 RemainAfterExit=yes
 ExecStartPre=/sbin/ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000
 ExecStart=/sbin/ip link set can0 up
 ExecStop=/sbin/ip link set can0 down
 [Install]
 WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then reload systemd and enable and start the can interface:

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable can0interface
systemctl start can0interface
```

Next, switch to your home directory and clone this repo and the repo for can-isotp

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joeFischetti/SimosHighSpeedLogger.git
git clone https://github.com/hartkopp/can-isotp.git
```

And then, set up can-isotp:

```bash
cd can-isotp
sudo apt install raspberrypi-kernel-headers
make
sudo depmod -a
sudo make modules_install
sudo insmod ./net/can/can-isotp.ko
sudo echo "/home/pi/can-isotp/net/can/can-isotp.ko" >> /etc/modules
```

When updating your kernel, you'll NEED to rebuild the kernel module:
```bash
cd ~/can-isotp
make clean
git pull
make
sudo depmod -a
sudo make modules_install
```

Finally, install some necessary python modules via pip:
```bash
sudo python3 -m pip install pyyaml udsoncan can-isotp
```


## TODO
Do a better job documenting the way the udev rules work (mainly - how to identify the sticks, and how to set them up)
Stop/Kill the logger when another USB stick is inserted into the pi.
